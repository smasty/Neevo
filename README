About Neevo
===========

First of all, thank you for downloading Neevo!

Neevo is a very small, fully object-oriented database abstraction layer for PHP.
It's open-source and released under the terms and conditions of the MIT license.

Neevo allows you to easily write SQL queries for different SQL drivers
in unified syntax with the use of Object-oriented PHP and fluent interfaces.
Of course, Neevo automatically escapes all code to avoid SQL Injection attacs, etc.

Neevo currently supports only one SQL driver - MySQL (through PHP extension 'mysql')
but more drivers are being prepared: PostgreSQL and SQLite for now. Neevo also offers
an Interface and Public API for other programmers, so new drivers can be easily added.


Features
========

 - SELECT queries (JOINs not supported)
 - INSERT queries
 - UPDATE queries
 - DELETE queries

 - Multiple drivers support (*)
 - More ways to fetch your data: as objects, indexed/associative arrays, key=>value pairs, single...
 - Affected rows
 - Retrieved rows
 - Seek
 - Table prefix support
 - Query execution time
 - Last executed query
 - Executed queries counter
 - Query and connection info
 - Randomize result order
 - Dump queries
 - Multi-level error-reporting system (based on Exceptions):
    - E_NONE:   No errors are reported.
    - E_HANDLE: All errors are made to Exceptions and then sent to defined
                (or default) error handler. (Exceptions are not thrown!)
    - E_STRICT: All errors are thrown as Exceptions.
 - Ability to use your own error handler.
 - One-file-only minified version with stripped comments and whitespace
    (Thanks to Jakub Vrana - http://php.vrana.cz and his Adminer - http://adminer.org)


Supported drivers
=================

 - MySQL (PHP extension 'mysql')


Todo
====

 - Better site and Public API documentation ;-)

 - PostgreSQL driver
 - SQLite driver
 - Show database and table structure (probably not)
 - MySQLi driver


Compiler
========

Neevo comes with what I call "compiler" - PHP CLI (command-line interface) script
which simplifies some boring work for me: Minifies source to one file without
comments and whitespace, regenerates PHPDoc and increments revision number.

Usage:
  $ php compile [options]

Options:

  -f=<filename>  File to compile. Defaults to neevo.php
  -r             Increments REVISION in <filename>
  -m             Minifies source code of <filename>
  -h             Displays help
  -q             Script produces no output

Minification part is made up from functions written by Jakub Vrana (http://php.vrana.cz)
